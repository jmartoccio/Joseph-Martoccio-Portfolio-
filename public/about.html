<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi all, my name is Joey Martoccio, a 24 year old living in Carmel, Indiana. I am orginally from Griffith, IN- a small town in Northwest Indiana. I lived there with my parents and sister until I left for college after graduation. Upon graduation from high school I went to Wabash College to play baseball. Wabash is a small liberal arts school in Crawfordsville, IN, and it is one of two all men institutes still left in the country. I was there for 4 years and graduated in 2021 with a Bachelors Degree in Economics. I now live in Carmel, Indiana with my wonderful girlfriend Kendal and our 2 year old dog Oakley. </p>

<p>After graduation from college in 2021 I accepted my first job as a carrier sales representative for Spot Logistics. My job there was to source lanes with different trucking companies and negotiate rates with the truckers so that they would take our product. I stayed with Spot for 8 months but ultimately decided it was'nt for me anymore. I started my job search not sure what I wanted to do yet, until I came across Apex Systems. I started working with Apex in Janruary of 2022 and am still there today. I work as a technical recruiter and so far it has gone really well for me, I have met a lot of great people, love my co-workers, and even got to go on a free vacation to Mexico this past March. My favorite take away so far from working at Apex is that it introduced me to the world of IT.</p>

<p>That is how I ended up taking Udemy bootcamp. Everyday I talk with people working within the IT idnustry in some capacity and it has really struck my interest into learning how to code. My goal with this course is to pick up a new passion and maybe even make a career shift into the IT world.</p>
